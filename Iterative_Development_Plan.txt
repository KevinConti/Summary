Iterative Development Platform

* Allow user to input what subreddits they want, the upvote amount to qualify a post, and the reddit account to send the message to. Save results to a config file.
* Have script that pulls scrapes posts from Reddit API and formats them appropriately
* Output appropriately


For way later
* Reddit account verification, so people don't send digests to accounts they don't own
* GUI version of app
