This program's goal is to offer a a weekly summary of the high points of user-submitted subreddits. 

Often times, there are subreddits whose top posts you enjoy, but you're not willing to stay subbed just for those high quality posts. This application lets you select which subreddits you wish to receive a weekly digest of, what number of upvotes will qualify a post, and what reddit account to receive the private message in.
